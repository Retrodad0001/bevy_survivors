## Learning Rust and Bevy

Learning the Rust language and the Bevy framework by building a 2D simplified survivors game and sharing it with the community.

# Constraints

- Only use built-in Bevy functionality (only `bevy-egui` is used as an external package/crate).
- Even when not needed in this context, I will try to maximize automatic testing to learn Rust and explore how far I can go within Bevy.
- Custom collision physics: I don't need the extra dependency and complexity (it's 2D; I hope I can manage it ;) ).
- Custom AI: I don't need the extra dependency and complexity (it's 2D; I hope I can manage it ;) ).
